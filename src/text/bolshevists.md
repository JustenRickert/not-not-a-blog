### _These Resources Are As Much Mine As They Are Yours_

_These resources are as much mine as they are yours_ is what one alien told another alien today. It was quite the situation. The quoted alien was one to have just come back from a foreign continent as part of a wartime effort. The other alien was one hailing from elite society, was protected from having to participate in the wartime effort for the reason that they needed to remain alive to sign payroll checks.

The quoted alien, having participated in the foreign continent's alien Bolshevist revolution, had become an erudite scholar of egalitarian ideology. They were not going to take any of the elite alien's wage theft bullshit.

Since your aliens are now capable of producing such riches, such problems are now possible. In worlds all across the Federation of Socialist Planets.
