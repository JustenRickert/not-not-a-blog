### The Importance of Good Measurement

The aliens didn't need precise measuring equipment to know such tidbits of information like how round the planet was, or how far away was the sun. Such tidbits of information related to much too big of a scale.

The need for precise measuring equipment comes from a much different point of view. Your aliens already systems of measurement. Being able to relay measurements is important for all kinds of things, so having already development common systems of measurement is essential. Being now so focused on measurement, however, your aliens interest themselves in measuring the smaller things.

They want to be able to measure subtle variations in material temperature. They want to be able to calculate physical constants related to gravitational pull. They want to have a like numerical insight into the shocking effects of static electricity and electrical capacitance.

Sure, like fine measurement isn't required to make a combustion engine or a good cup of tea, but it is required to make high performance electrical engine and the _perfect_ cup of tea.
