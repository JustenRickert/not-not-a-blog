### Civilization Beginning

These aliens are truly unique. They can make metals now. They do it by throwing slimy, colored rocks into a very hot furnace. When the furnace cools down they find pebbles of metal melted together at the bottom. It's very impressive that they figured out that the colored slime was rust and indicative of deposits of metal.

It will be interesting to see what about metals your aliens will take interest in more: The physical and chemical composition of them, or the mechanical and crafty things that could be made from them.

If they end up anything like Goulpian aliens---who are interested in chemistry---they might find ways to mix the metals with other materials to make ingestible compounds. They'll like find that their ingestible compounds will promote heart health and they'll live longer, or they'll discover all kinds of ways to cause ego death and they'll learn to understand themselves better.

If they go the other way---the way of mechanics and crafts and construction---then they may end up more like the Dregons or the Xa Kinaxen. If your aliens are Dregon-like then they'll make the metals into hammers, swords, and high performance exercise equipment; they'll tune their bodies to physical perfection and intuitively breed their species for the corresponding evolutionary traits. If your aliens are more Xa Kinaxe-like then they'll make the metals into mechanical trinkets, machinery, and automated computing devices. Eventually---as Xa Kinaxen-like aliens---they'll be able to make equipment capable of approximating the ratio of a circle's radius to its circumference with arbitrary precision or some such nonsense.

Either way, they'll be more like on par with the aliens of the Federation of Socialist Planets, meaning they'll be least more "useful" to the Federation. They'll have more of economic viability in the highly competitive intergalactic resource trade, and they'll be closer to assimilation with the rest of the intergalactic aliens. How they do this can only be told by the inevitable unraveling of time, and, of course, your various instigations.
