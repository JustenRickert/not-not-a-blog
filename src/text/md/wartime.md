### Alien Infighting

With great technology comes great opportunity to have more power than others. With constant advent of new technology, your aliens have hardly any time to make sure that their neighbors stay updated.

Your society regularly divides itself according to these technological variations.

Some aliens know various pastoral technologies. They live simple nomadic lifestyles and must regularly defend themselves against aliens with access to equine knowledge and raiding weaponry.

Some aliens use their advanced knowledge of hand tools to create and don extravagant ceremonial cloth. These cloth-donning, often-profligate, often-cultish mouth runners often inspire their fellow aliens to flaunt their apparent advancedness. This often leads to wars against others for no reason other than the other's golden chalices were the wrong shape or their respective ceremonial cloths were the wrong color or their resources were being stored in the wrong collection bins.

These sorts of infights are common in Dregon alien cultures.
