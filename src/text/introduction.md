### Introduction

It's a bright room. Not a dark room. It's like usually that things start out in a dark room. Like eyes open up, it's hard to see for a moment or something, then someone proclaims something obvious like _Looks like you're awake_.

Not this time. This time it's a bright room. There's no one in particular paying any attention.

There is the noise of footsteps in the background. Many footsteps. Accompanying the footsteps are voices. Many voices speaking in many different conversations. It's the kind of talking one would expect a businessperson to make. The word _sales_ can be made out clearly.

A row of chairs sit against a wall. At the end of the row of chairs is a door labeled with the name of a person and their title: _Plorkis Crok, Recruitment Director_.

The chairs are owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation. The door is owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation and labels the employee in charge in of bringing new employees into it. Every chair is filled with a potential new employee of the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation, and, well, they will probably soon be owned too.

All around are blinking panels. Above some of them are large portholes to the endless outer space. Outside the portholes, between the very distance, untwinkling stars, are commercial spacecrafts of all kinds docking and departing from impressive spacecraft carriers.

Altogether, the scene represents the business accomplishments of the Federation of Socialist Planets.

The door opens up.

"You ready?" An alien appears delighted to see you.

There's a finger pointing in your direction. Without being told, you follow Recruitment Director Plorkis Crok into the room behind the door owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.

Plorkis Crok, a Xa Kinaxen alien, seats you across from the alien's desk (owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation) and asks you about yourself. There's a piece of paper handed off with information required to fill out. The alien tells a brief tale about contents of the form, chortling all the while. Plorkis Crok is a very happy alien.

After talking through a series of seemingly unrelated topics, it is explained that the position has already been approved for you and that this meeting---this _interview_---is just a formality. The true purpose of your being here is to fill out the form. Filling it out means the job is yours.
