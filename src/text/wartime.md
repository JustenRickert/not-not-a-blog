### Alien Infighting

With great technology comes great opportunity to have more power than others. With a constant advent of new technology, your aliens have hardly any time to make sure that their neighbors stay updated.

Your society regularly divides itself according to these technological variations. Some aliens living nomadic lifestyles, knowing various pastoral technologies, must regularly defend themselves against aliens with access to equine knowledge and raiding weapons.

On occasion, aliens who believe themselves to be technologically underdeveloped will take up pitchforks (or whatever is the current technology of revolt) and attempt to take it by force from their technologically overdeveloped fellows.
