### Post Interview

Plorkis Crok receives your name and desired assignment, says it is assuredly yours. The alien makes a noise to indicate some amount of excitement, then ushers you out the door and gives a platitudinal remark about the hopefulness of your future at the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.
    
Back outside the office---in the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation recruitment module---there are aliens of all kinds in the waiting area near the entrance. They are Dregons, Goulps, Suun Stroundae, and even a Traxene.

Passing by them, it is clear they were all recently disappointed. It was probably Plorkis Crok who made them all so disappointed and sitting there so despondently. It was probably that the enchantingly happy Xa Kinaxen alien---the who'd just handed you a corporate position by doing nothing more than writing down your name---just informed these disappointed aliens that there would not be room for them at the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.

You try to avoid making any eye contact with the disenchanted aliens. Looking around, you observe all the other aliens working in the Contraxis recruitment office module. They are mostly Xa Kinaxen aliens; all the terminals they operate are of Xa Kinaxen construction, built on the planet of Xa Kinaxe. The resources used to construct the business operation terminals, as well as the blinking panels, doors, chairs, spaceship portholes to the endless outer space and commercial spacecrafts, were likely all transported through the intergalactic resource trade of the Federation of Socialist Planets.

The position just attained within the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation has to do with the intergalactic resource trade of the Federation of Socialist Planets. Your assignment is on a planet. Your job is to grow a population of fledgling aliens, to advance their species and their technological capabilities, to integrate them into the universe of corporatist aliens, the Federation of Socialist Planets.
