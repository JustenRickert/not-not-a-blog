### The New Aliens on the Block

These new aliens are quite boring to look at. They mostly play around with sticks and rocks all day. They seem to have the capabilities of intelligent life: They've already created like words for trees and water and sex and the sun. They like breaking rocks apart, and they've found that if they break the right rocks apart and in just the right way that the broken up rocks can be sharp enough to cut things with.

It might be useful to intervene, to show them that they might be able to use the like circumstantially sharpened rocks to their benefit.
