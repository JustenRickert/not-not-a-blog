### Tree Felling

Your aliens {ALIEN} are apparently tree felling folk. After they chopped down the amount that they thought was enough, they started to think through what they might actually be able to do them.

This is an important breakthrough for the new aliens {ALIEN}. The ability to see through the mere material aspects of the things around them for the _potential_ that those mere material things might give them makes them able to conceive of such things as houses {HOUSE}. They no longer wish to just keep themselves dry in the rain by sheltering in a cave. They've carved out enough makeshift hand axes from the insides of flint or chert, and tied together enough pieces of twisted tree bark fibers to create string that they need somewhere to put all of it.

Being able to create houses {HOUSE} allows them to settle down and increase their alien {ALIEN} population capacity. Slowly their population will explode. Or something I'm sure. They might even one day be able to create enough resources to start trading measurable amounts of material with the rest of the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION}.

You just keep at it!
