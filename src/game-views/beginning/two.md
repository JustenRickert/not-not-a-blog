### Trees

The aliens {ALIEN} are sick of food!

Well, not actually, I guess. But they're starting to be more interested in other things. They've taken their thoughts to the trees. Or---rather---they're bringing the trees to their thoughts. Timber {TREE} is now unlocked.

It was once explained to me that the desire to bring down nature was the genesis of disbelief in God. It was that the time of tilling the earth for crops and making shelter from anything other than dirt and rock, was the time of Godlessness. Ancient Greek religious beliefs kept nature and their mythological objects close together. When Hades kidnaps Persephone, daughter of the agriculture goddess Demeter, endless winter descends and famine becomes widespread.

The other point of view says that the land was a gift from the Almighty, and so could be changed without any moral insinuations---God's conferral of dominion over creation in Christianity. I guess it is yet to be determined what the aliens {ALIEN} think about gifts from the Almighty.
