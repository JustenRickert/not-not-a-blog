Productivity. It's not exactly the key. Agriculture {TRACTOR} yields biological material useful to make food with. Aliens {ALIEN} will eat the food {DINNER_PLATE} and grow strong. Without the food {DINNER_PLATE} the aliens {ALIEN} will die, but without it they survive. Aliens {ALIEN} are resilient.

Aliens {ALIEN} can be put to work and laid off.

Just like people are!

Around these parts, alien {ALIEN} lives are shaped by the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION}. By playing this game you have become a member of the Federation {FEDERATION}. You lead a society of alien {ALIEN} workers whose planet's resources are all collected and redistributed by the state (you). You do not profit from having ownership over the resources. You must redistribute the resources however you see fit.

You are a member of the Federation. An economist. A planet emperor.

Though you must call yourself a socialist while wearing the badge of the Federation of Socialist Aliens {FEDERATION}, you can be whoever you want to be. You are only you. You are not he or she or they or what or how or even why. If I say otherwise it is most definitely a mistake and I would appreciate it if you file a bug report! :)

Though you must call yourself a socialist, you need not play as one. As you can see before you you have many options. You could employ aliens {ALIEN}, strive to keep employment a universal right, and make sure that there is not one alien contributing to the unemployment statistic you can find in the quick view at the top by clicking the {ALIEN}. You could layoff aliens {ALIEN} on a whim, maintain the ability to capitalize on changes in markets that will become more diverse as new industries and ways to play the game become available. You could even choose anarchy, take no part in choosing the lives of aliens {ALIEN}.

You are you, after all.
