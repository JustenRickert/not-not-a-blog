### Tree Felling

Your aliens {ALIEN} are apparently tree felling folk. After they chopped down the amount that they thought was enough, they started to think through what they might actually be able to do with the timber.

This is an important breakthrough for the new aliens {ALIEN}. The ability to see through the mere material aspects of the things around them for the _potential_ that those mere material things might give them makes them able to conceive of such things as houses {HOUSE}. They no longer wish to just keep themselves dry in the rain by sheltering in a cave. They've carved out enough makeshift hand axes from the insides of flint or chert, and tied together enough pieces of twisted tree bark fibers to create string that they need somewhere to put all of it.

Being able to create houses {HOUSE} allows them to settle down and increase their alien {ALIEN} population capacity. Slowly, their population will explode exponentially. <sup>Or something I'm sure.</sup> They might even one day be able to create enough resources to start trading measurable amounts of material with the rest of the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION}.

The more advanced planets usually garner the attention of Marv and Navakin, employees of the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation {CONTRAXIS}. Marv and Navakin hail from the planet Dolorene, far away from the stretches of space your planet occupies, light-years from any of the nearby intergalactic trade routes.

Marv and Navakin are a breed of telepathically communicating Dolorene aliens called Khazakian. Upon assimilating with the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION}, Dolorene aliens were made nearly extinct. Alas, there are many ways that assimilation with the Federation {FEDERATION} goes. The Khazakian breed of Dolorene aliens used their telepathic powers to narrowly escape complete obliteration. Marv and Navakin and friends chose to not follow the rank and file military opposition to the Federation of Socialist Planets occupation {FEDERATION}, instead used their telepathic communication powers to manipulate just the right minds of extra-alien Federation colonizers to be taken in as Dolorene refugees.

In the War of Dolorene, Dolorene aliens took lives of Federation aliens at a ratio of thirteen-thousand Federation aliens to one. Over the course of two-hundred-seventy-four (planet Earth) years, forty-billion Dolorene aliens traded their lives for that of over five-hundred-trillion extra-aliens of the Federation. Marv and Navakin lived to see every minute of those long two-hundred-seventy-four years. In their new lives as Federation aliens, they work for the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation {CONTRAXIS}. They explore the mostly empty outer space in search of new planets with alien life, seeking to expand the Federation of Socialist Planets intergalactic trade route {FEDERATION}.

Anyway, you just keep at it!
