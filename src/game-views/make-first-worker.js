That's okay. This is an incremental game, that means numbers increment or
decrement. Like this one here: ${"ðŸ”º" + whole(state.user.points)}. That symbol
is me being lazy, basically. I wanted to add something to make it easier to
recognize what I was looking at a glance. It's just an emoji (a code point
U+1F53A that gets rendered to a symbol in a web browser). What follows the
symbol is what you want to make go up. Right now it's only going up by one, once
per second.
