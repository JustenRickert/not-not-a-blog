### More and more and more

There probably won't be many more other than these new ones. That's how intuitions usually are about technology and industry. Every century sees the last of the world's greatest innovations, so as to make the coming century usher in the end of civilization.

That's what the Dolorene aliens thought about the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION}. They believed the extra-aliens were bringing them the last frontier of technological advancement. They'd hoped that it would have been they themselves who would be the ones to carry such a flag---so to speak. So when the Federation {FEDERATION} made contact with their beloved planet Dolorene---displaying to the Dolorene aliens their advanced intergalactic space vehicles and language discovery, recognition, and translation devices---the Dolorene aliens responded by showing the extra-aliens the bayoneted ends of their most advanced military equipment.

Their most advanced military equipment was unlike anything the Federation {FEDERATION} had seen. While most aliens {ALIEN} of the Federation {FEDERATION} spent their time creating innovation commercial goods, things that could be bought and sold on the Federation of Socialist Planets intergalactic trade route by various consumerist alien types {ALIEN}, Dolorene aliens spent their time creating offensive and defensive wartime technologies.

Dolorene aliens lived brutal existences. Their biological makeup let each one live multiple (planet Earth) millennia. The unluckiest of Dolorene aliens lived long enough lives to see multiple civilizations rise and fall, to have tens of life's works created, to raise hundreds of families, and to witness thousands of friends and family members pass away. The great length of time they lived exacerbated their interest in immortality, and a great majority of Dolorene aliens vied for prestigious positions in their Dolorene alien history books.

Such interests usually detracted from ideas as Communal Thought.

Such interests usually lead to decimation of others vying for the same ideals.

Dolorene aliens too interested in constructing lasting civilizations often found the fruits of their labor turned into rubble. Those who spent their thinking time creating inspirational works of art usually found themselves looking at the shreds of those works under the feet of others who demonstrated interests in machinery and machinations. Family-oriented Dolorene aliens struggled to find meaning against the power-oriented, self-interested aliens who didn't mind committing genocide. Despite their potential for long, fruitful lives, most died at young ages because of the murderous tendencies of their peers.

So when the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION} came to the planet Dolorene, the Dolorene aliens were prepared to greet them with highly-advanced wartime technologies, with massive budgets and infrastructure for building weapons of mass destruction and infantry carrier vehicles, with war flags ready to plant on the corpses of defeated enemies, with ornamental bayonets fixed to ends of their alien rifles. When the Federation {FEDERATION} came to Dolorene, it was the first time in all of Dolorene history that all of Dolorene found themselves a common cause: To destroy the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION}.
