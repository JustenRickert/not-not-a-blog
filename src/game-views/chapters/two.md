#### Trees

The aliens {ALIEN} are sick of food!

Well, not actually, I guess. But they're starting to be more interested in other things. They've taken their thoughts to the trees. Or---rather---they're bringing the trees to their thoughts. Timber {TREE} is now unlocked.

It was once explained to me that the desire to bring down nature was the genesis of disbelief in God. It is to say that the time of tilling the earth for crops and making shelter from anything other than dirt and rock, is a time of Godlessness. Ancient Greek religious beliefs kept nature and their mythological objects close together. When Hades kidnaps Persephone, daughter of the agriculture goddess Demeter, endless winter descends and famine becomes widespread.

The other point of view says that the land is a gift from the Almighty, and so can be changed without any moral insinuations---because of God's conferral of dominion over creation in Christianity. I guess it is yet to be determined what the aliens {ALIEN} think about gifts from the Almighty.

In the vastness of outer space---where there resides an infinity of alien species {ALIEN} and an even greater infinity of alien thoughts and ideas {ALIEN}---there is a surprising poverty of religious thinking. The desire to prescribe meaning to daily life according to a framework of some higher power is particularly human.

The minds of most aliens {ALIEN} across the cosmoses yields to burden of proof when working with such questions as the _meaning of life_.

Though there is surely something unique to human thinking compared to the kinds of aliens {ALIEN} found in this game {THE_GAME}. Certainly, it has to do with the differences in the kind of simulation each exists inside of.
