### The New Aliens on the Block

These new aliens are quite boring to look at. They mostly play around with sticks and rocks all day. They seem to have the capabilities of intelligent life: They've already created words for trees and water and sex and the sun. They like breaking rocks apart, and they've found that if they break the right rocks apart and in just the right way that the broken up rocks can be sharp enough to cut things with.

You've shown them that using these broken rocks might actually be useful, that they can be used as _hand tools_, so maybe these new aliens will start being not quite so boring to look at. 

They might start cutting down vegetation, to clear areas that are not otherwise walkable; or they maybe they'll start to use the sharp rocks (umm _hand tools_) as tools to hunt down animals, to give them the ability to gather protein from the surrounding wildlife, to augment their diet and let them live off the land more efficiently; or they could be shown that the sharpened rocks might facilitate the harvesting of things like tree branches, materials that could be put together to create shelter and help settle the land.

The Dregon aliens, known for their musculature, lived their lives in dirt pits before the Federation of Socialist Planets came to their planet. Perhaps it was the planet's climate that influenced the Dregons to prefer the simplicity of habitation without rooves over their heads. When the assigned Federation alien arrived, one by the name of Stem Kiex, the Dregons were shown how to weave together the leaves of their planet's vegetation into thatching.

The Dregons, their lifestyles previously bound to the need to hunt near-daily for survival's sake, determined, with the help of Stem Kiex, that they needed to commercialize their way of life. With the aids of collars, the design of which Stem Kiex influenced, the Dregons learned to domesticate the animals they'd previously hunted.

Given the newfound ownership over the animals of the land, the ideas of commerce, and ability to lord over the lands, the Dregons civilized themselves. In retrospect the Federation did little to influence the inherent culture. Stem Kiex only the supplied the tools with which a Dregon could more dramatically assert his cultural influences and deny another Dregon their own. With .

The usefulness of these new aliens in the eyes of the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation lies in their ability to innovate technologically. Xa Kinaxen aliens, for example, have proven themselves to be adept with computational technologies. Their prestige among Federation types follows from their ability to utilize more than just the typical electronic manipulations of materials to create computer hardware. They've incorporated the spooky actions of atomic and subatomic materials to achieve faster computation speeds from unliving material than any other alien.

Goulpian aliens, though in general less renown than Xa Kinaxen aliens among Federation types, owe their prestige to endeavors in chemistry. Though on occasion remarked for their psychedelic <sup>mis</sup>adventures, Goulpian aliens know better than any other what the most effective techniques might be for the synthesis of any compound. Certain Goulpian aliens like Marix Courvie have had their names put in practically every primary education curriculum of every planet of the Federation of Socialist Planets, and certain other Goulpian aliens like Ximophi Learvie fail to be obscured by what are---essentially---the indoctrination systems of the galaxies.

There are similar stories for Dregon aliens, who are known for innovations in musculature advancement; Suun Strounda aliens, known for their mastery of abstract reasoning and mathematics; and Traxene aliens who've founded techniques for enhancing neurological capabilities. Meanwhile---in showing the new aliens of your assignment the potential usefulness of circumstantially sharpened rocks---your aliens have taken to debarking trees and using the long strands of the stuff to make string. They have taken to twisting together pieces of string long enough to wear around their yet unclothed bodies. Though they're obviously more culturally advanced than they were before, it is yet to be determined if they'll find any sort of like economic benefit from the innovation.

At least these new aliens are not quite as boring to look at.

There is one with a keen lack of boringness. The aliens call this enemy of dullness by the name {{newAlienHero}}. With a hand tool in alien appendage, {{newAlienHero}} showed that almost everything could be done much more easily with the use of tools. In response, the aliens of {{planetName}} made {{newAlienHero}} their leader. It was an era of prosperity, and, for a moment at least, you forgot all about the Federation of Socialist Planets and the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.
