### Introduction

It's a bright room. Not a dark room. It's like usually that things start out in a dark room. Like eyes open up, it's hard to see for a moment or something, then someone proclaims something obvious like _Looks like you're awake_.

Not this time. This time it's a bright room. There's no one in particular paying any attention.

There is the noise of footsteps in the background. Many footsteps. Accompanying the footsteps are voices. Many voices speaking in many different conversations, the kind of conversations businesspeople have. The word _sales_ can be made out clearly and numerously.

A row of chairs sit against a wall. At the end of the row of chairs is a door labeled with a name and a title: _Plorkis Crok, Recruitment Director_.

The chairs are owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation. The door is owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation and labels the employee in charge of bringing new employees into it. Every chair is filled with a potential new employee of the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation, and, well, they will probably soon be owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation too.

All around are blinking panels. Above some of them are large portholes to the endless outer space. Outside the portholes, between the very distance, untwinkling stars, are commercial spacecrafts of all kinds docking and departing from impressive spacecraft carriers. The commercial spacecrafts are not entirely owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation. However, the impressive spacecrafts carriers are.

Altogether, the scene represents the business accomplishments of the Federation of Socialist Planets. In commemoration of such extraordinary accomplishments, the government of the Federation of Socialist Planets provided funded directly to the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation to build the space station _Notnotablog_.

The door opens up.

"You ready?" An alien appears delighted to see you. 

There's a finger pointing in your direction. Without being told, you follow Recruitment Director Plorkis Crok into the room behind the door owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.

The alien welcomes you aboard the _Notnotablog_. "Welcome!" says the alien. The alien provides for you the name Plorkis Crok, commenting on how it's the same name as what's labeled on the office door.

Plorkis Crok, obviously a Xa Kinaxen alien, seats you across from the alien's desk (owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation) and asks you about yourself. There's a piece of paper handed off with information required to fill out. The alien tells a brief tale about the contents of the form, indicating an intimate knowledge of it. The alien chortles all the while. Plorkis Crok is clearly a happy alien.

After talking through a series of seemingly unrelated topics with the loquacious alien, it is explained that the position has already been approved for you and that this meeting---this _interview_---is just a formality. The true purpose of your being here is to fill out the form. Filling it out means the job is yours.
