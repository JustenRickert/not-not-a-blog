### Introduction

It's a bright room. It's like usually that things start out in a dark room. Like eyes open up, it's hard to see for a moment or something, then someone proclaims something obvious like _Looks like you're awake_. 

Not this time. This is not a dark room. There's no one in particular paying any attention.

There noise the background. Footsteps. Lots of them. Accompanying the footsteps are voices. Many voices speaking in many different conversations, the kind of conversations businesspeople have. The word _sales_ can be made out again and again. The word _sales_ is being said with many different alien accents and a few different alien languages.

A row of chairs sits against a wall. At the end of the row of chairs is a door. The door is labeled _Plorkis Crok, Recruitment Director_.

The chairs are owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation. The door is owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation and labels the employee in charge of bringing in new employees. Every chair is filled with a potential new employee of the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation, and, well, they too will probably soon be owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.

All around are blinking panels. Above some of the blinking panels are large portholes to the endless outer space. Outside the portholes, between the very distance, untwinkling stars, are spacecrafts of all kinds docking and departing from impressive spacecraft carriers. The spacecrafts are behemoth, extravagant examples of what happens when a very diverse collection of alien engineers work together. The spacecraft carriers also. The spacecrafts are not entirely owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation; however, the impressive spacecraft carriers are.

Altogether, the scene represents the accomplishments of the Federation of Socialist Planets. What the Federation of Socialist Planets once accomplished was bringing together aliens from all over the galaxies. To this day this is what it continues to do. In commemoration of such an extraordinary pastime, the government of the Federation of Socialist Planets provided funded to the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation to build the space station _Notnotablog_.

You are aboard this space station.

Welcome to _Notnotablog_.

<hr>

The door opens up.

"You ready?" An alien appears delighted to see you. 

There's a finger pointing in your direction. Without being told, you follow Recruitment Director Plorkis Crok into the room behind the door owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.

The alien welcomes you aboard the _Notnotablog_. "Welcome!" says the alien. The alien explains that Plorkis Crok, the name that's labeled on the office door, is the alien's own.

Plorkis Crok, a Xa Kinaxen alien according to appearance, seats you across from the alien's desk (owned by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation) and asks you about yourself. There's a piece of paper handed off with information required to fill out. The alien tells a not-so-brief tale about the contents of the form, chortling all the while. Plorkis Crok, the happiest alien you've ever had the pleasure to talk to, seems to know the form intimately.

After talking through a series of seemingly unrelated topics with the loquacious alien, Plorkis Crok explains that the position has already been approved for you and that this meeting---this _interview_---is just a formality. The true purpose of your being here is to fill out the form. Filling it out means the job is yours.

You really wonder.

<hr>

Outside the space station _Notnotablog_ is the endless frontier of space. There is no alien in the universe with vision great enough to see across the entirety of it, not even with technological aids. Some philosophical Federation aliens posit that the endlessness of space is even greater in magnitude than the endlessness of thought. Some pious Federation aliens believe that space is so unimaginably vast that not even a creator deity could have constructed it. Some humorist Federation aliens wonder why these aliens even waste their time thinking about it.

What a laugh.

An author, one who self-diagnoses as a genuine neurotic, might characterize the endlessness of space as being like dimensionally equivalent to intelligent life's collective time lost thinking about precious fragments and not so precious fragments of involuntary memory.

Such is the nature of intelligence. It is that aliens tall and wide, short and skinny, or anywhere in between, cannot remember well enough all of the seconds they've lost rehashing the times they've felt good or bad or traumatized or whatever else to be able to count them each and add them all up.

For a short period of time, a period of time just long enough to spell out a long like soliloquy, the self-diagnosed genuine neurotic author turns into a kind of philosophical mathematician, says some crazy nonsense like _The endlessness equivalency condition is no longer met when considering_ false _involuntary memories such as the following_:

<!-- Post-Modern Prophet Disorder -->

> I am renting a house, which I share with a roommate. On my way to work, crossing the Hulen Street bridge. Heavy fog. I just make out cars sliding, colliding ahead. I put on the brakes, but I can't see anything. I begin honking the horn so other cars will know I am here. Then all goes white, lost in total fog. Next I find myself inexplicably standing outside the garage of my rented house. I punch in the access code, and the automatic garage door rises. My roommate's car is here, but not mine. Inside the house, a party is under way. Some of my relatives are here. So are some friends. Someone---maybe my roommate---explains what has occurred: I am actually a carbon copy of the original Mark Sheldon, who was killed on the bridge in the fog. I don't feel like a copy; however, that is because I have all of the memories of the original. I am an exact copy. Then my roommate and I look outside. We realize somehow that all of the cars are gone now. A world without cars. Could this be a world of carbon copies, a world without original people? So we walk outside, look at the next door neighbor's home. They have a swimming pool, but it's in the front yard. And on the front walk next to the pool is a three-wheeled, robotic pool cleaner. This is a troubling sight, for I see the robot as part of a vast conspiracy to eliminate the original people of the world and replace them with carbon copies. I persuade my roommate to help me flip this robot onto its head. We run away, and I am laughing. Even when I see that the homeowners are watching me through the picture window, I am still laughing. But my roommate doesn't find it so funny. He tells me this is bad. We'll have to pay for the damages.

You are glad that your search for meaning in the universe need not go any further. For it seems your present purpose in life can be fixed to a job working for the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation. You need not travel any further in any of the other directions in the endlessness of space. For the moment you feel as happy as the happy alien Plorkis Crok. The form in front of you asks that you fill out it, you know what awaits: the creature comforts of a steady paycheck signed by the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation on behalf of the Federation of Socialist Planets.

Hooray.
