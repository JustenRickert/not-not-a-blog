### Post Interview

Plorkis Crok receives your name and desired assignment, says it is assuredly yours. The alien makes a noise to indicate some amount of excitement, then ushers you out the door and gives a platitudinal remark about the hopefulness of your future at the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation. The alien also wishes you the best of luck in not getting lost while finding your way out of the _Keebo_. The alien laughs as you walk away.
    
Back outside the office---in the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation recruitment center, inside the _Keebo_ module of the space station---there are aliens of all kinds in the waiting area near the entrance. They are Dregons, Goulps, Suun Stroundae, and even a Traxene.

Passing by them, it is clear they were all recently disappointed. It was probably Plorkis Crok who made them all so disappointed so that they would sit there so despondently. It was probably that the enchantingly happy Xa Kinaxen alien---who'd just handed you a corporate position by doing nothing more than writing down your name---just informed each of these disappointed aliens that there would not be room for them at the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.

A blessing, perhaps.

You try to avoid making any eye contact with the disenchanted aliens. Looking around, you observe all employees working in the Contraxis recruitment office module. These working aliens don't look disappointed.

They are mostly Xa Kinaxen aliens, not likely born on their home planet; all the terminals they operate are of Xa Kinaxen construction, likely built on the planet of Xa. The resources used to construct these business operation terminals, as well as the blinking panels, doors, chairs, spaceship portholes to the endless outer space and commercial spacecrafts, were likely all transported through the intergalactic resource trade of the Federation of Socialist Planets.

The position just attained within the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation has to do with the intergalactic resource trade of the Federation of Socialist Planets. This is what Plorkis Crok told you about between bouts of cackling. Your assignment is on a planet, and your job is to entice a population of fledgling aliens to the ways of technological progress. You are to advance their species and their capabilities, and to eventually integrate them into the universe of corporatist aliens known as the Federation of Socialist Planets.

A true joy.

On {{planetName}}, after your ship lands, you leave it to look around. You _have_ to leave it because you unfortunately crash-landed. There's hardly anything to salvage from the wreckage except some alien language translation tools and stuff make yourself at home with on this strange alien planet. Everything else is smoldering. Most of the onboard equipment wasn't very accessible to you anyway, because it was designed for the alien appendages of a Xa Kinaxen alien, appendages which you do not have.

After applying some bandages to some mild scrapes you luckily acquired in lieu of certain, explosive death, you walk around to enjoy the planetary scenery, smell the fresh, plant-scented, alien air---which is much cleaner than the air your old spaceship was recycling---and look around for something to give your new alien life meaning. It doesn't take you more than a few hours to make first contact with intelligent alien life on {{planetName}}.

Given the way your alien language translation tool operates, by transmitting the aliens' translated vocals into an earpiece in your ear and responding by putting your thoughts directly their consciences, the intelligent alien life on {{planetName}} isn't sure what to make of you. They do not collectively understand the universe well enough to conceive of extraterrestrial alien life. They're simultaneously in awe of you and afraid of you, and treat you as some kind of a liminal being. They're not sure if you're supposed to be some kind of deity, or a manifestation of some kind of collective insanity.
