### Post Interview

Plorkis Crok receives your name and desired assignment, says it is assuredly yours. The alien makes a noise to indicate some amount of excitement, then ushers you out the door, gives a platitudinal remark about the hopefulness of your future at the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation. The alien also wishes you the best of luck in not getting lost while finding your way out of the _Keebo_. The alien laughs as you walk away.
    
Back outside the office---in the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation recruitment center, what is called the _Keebo_ module of the space station _Notnotablog_---there are aliens of all kinds. In the waiting room, sitting in all different alien fashions, are Dregons, Goulps, Suun Stroundae, and even a Traxene.

Passing by them, it is clear they were all recently disappointed. It was probably Plorkis Crok who made them all so disappointed so that they would sit there so despondently. It was probably that the enchantingly happy Xa Kinaxen alien---who'd just handed you a corporate position after asking you to do nothing more than write something down on a form---just informed each of these disappointed aliens that there would not be room for them at the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation.

A blessing, perhaps.

You wonder why they were even asked to come in.

You try to avoid making any eye contact with the disenchanted aliens. It's a shame, at the very least. Looking elsewhere around the _Keebo_, you observe employees working in the Contraxis recruitment office module. These working aliens don't look disappointed. They don't look quite as happy as Plorkis Crok, but maybe they don't need to talk to aliens like Plorkis Crok does.

The working aliens are mostly Xa Kinaxen. Lightyears from where their species originated, where they're "really from," one can assume they're native to nowhere. All the terminals they operate are of Xa Kinaxen construction, possibly built on the planet of Xa, possibly generations older than they are. The resources used to construct these business operation terminals, as well as the blinking panels, doors, chairs, spaceship portholes to the endless outer space and commercial spacecrafts, were likely all transported through the intergalactic resource trade of the Federation of Socialist Planets.

The position just attained within the Contraxis Space Exploration corporation has to do with the intergalactic resource trade of the Federation of Socialist Planets. This is what Plorkis Crok told you about between bouts of cackling. For a moment, you are either relieved or disappointed to not be talking with the alien; you're not sure which. Your assignment is on the planet {{planetName}}, as you asked for, and your job is to entice a population of fledgling aliens to the ways of technological progress. You are to advance their species and their capabilities, and to eventually integrate them into the universe of corporatist aliens known as the Federation of Socialist Planets.

A true joy.

Plorkis Crok, in the alien's own stint as a green employee of the Contraxis Space Exploration Corporation, failed to entice fledgling aliens to the ways of technological progress. The alien's report on why the mission didn't go as planned, explained that "the planet Pok Pok had climate conditions unsuited to making civility of a brutish species," as the alien said in their own words.

The report, submitted without any sort of verification, explained that the Pok Pok aliens "could not overcome their barbarian instincts when it came to rallying behind technological idealism," and that they "slowly blew themselves up in a carbon frenzy when just a few of them figured out how to create distractions and steal important resources for their own purposes." The report ended with an explanation of how the Pok Pok species will likely live on somewhere in the endless outer space, somewhere where the Pok Pok species' richest citizen decided to blast off their gigantic habitable biodome of a spacecraft, along with their own self and family and friends; while the fumes of the spacecraft's rocket system burned up the last of the planet's remaining chemicals in the air necessary for the rest of the species' respiration, necessary for the rest of the species to live.

Plorkis Crok never got to talk to the emigrant, never once had an opportunity to tell them that they were part of a grand experiment set up by the Federation of Socialist Planets.

Anyway...

On {{planetName}}, after your ship lands, you leave it to look around. You _have_ to leave it because you unfortunately crash-land. There's hardly anything to salvage from the wreckage except some alien language translation tools and some things make yourself feel at home with on this strange alien planet. Everything else is smoldering, about to turn to ash, and there's you can do about it. Most of the onboard equipment wasn't very accessible to you anyway, because it was designed for the alien appendages of a Xa Kinaxen alien, appendages which you do not have.

After applying some bandages to some mild scrapes you acquired in lieu of certain, explosive death, you walk around to enjoy the planetary scenery, smell the fresh, plant-scented, alien air---which is much cleaner than the air your old spaceship was recycling---and look around for something to give your new alien life meaning. You consider yourself lucky. It doesn't take you more than a few hours to make first contact with intelligent alien life on {{planetName}}.

Given the way your alien language translation tool operates, by transmitting the aliens' translated vocals into an earpiece in your ear and responding by putting your thoughts directly their consciences, the intelligent alien life on {{planetName}} is bewildered. They do not, collectively, understand the universe well enough to conceive of extraterrestrial alien life. They're simultaneously in awe of you and afraid of you, and treat you as some kind of a liminal being. They're not sure if you're some kind of deity, or a manifestation of a kind of collective insanity they're all experiencing.

You decide to keep your distance, and interact with them in as limited a way as possible.
