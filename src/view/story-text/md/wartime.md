### Alien Infighting

With great technology comes great opportunity to have more power than others. With constant new technology, your aliens have hardly any time to make sure that their neighbors stay up-to-date.

Your society regularly divides itself because of access to technology.

Some aliens know various pastoral technologies. They live simple, nomadic lifestyles. Sometimes, however, they have to defend themselves against aliens with access to equine knowledge and raiding weaponry.

Some aliens use their advanced knowledge of hand tools to create and don extravagant ceremonial cloth. These cloth-donning, often-profligate, often-cultish mouth runners inspire their fellow aliens to flaunt their apparent advancedness. This often leads to wars against others for no reason other than the other's golden chalices were the wrong shape or their respective ceremonial cloths were the wrong color or their resources were being stored in the wrong collection bins.

This sort of alien infighting is common among Federation hopefuls, because of their usual _apatheia_ problems. In their pre-Federation days, Dregon aliens clad with muscles punished Dregons who didn't live for physical perfection. They did so by forcing puny, apathetic Dregons to duel. It was an attempt to show Dregons who weren't sympathetic to the peak physicality cause, that being apathetic would result in untimely demise. Of course, the physically stronger Dregons would usually win in a duel. The culture repeatedly pushed the edge of Dregon perfection, causing innovators to create more and better physical enhancement technologies and dueling methodologies until Dregon aliens were virtually unmatched.

Suun Strounda aliens were also bound to the problem paradigm of _apatheia_. Their sexual tendencies grew to revolve around their affinity for abstract reasoning and mathematics. Those who eschewed the norms effectively yielded their reproductive power to the Suun Stroundae who studied their culture's abstract reasoning and mathematical literature. Similar to the Dregons, Suun Strounda culture pushed the edge of Suun Strounda perfection. Innovators on the planet of Suun created more and better scholarly methodology that Suun Strounda became virtually unmatched when it came to critical thinking skills.

Your aliens, now advanced in the ways of _hand tools_, now too know _apatheia_ problems. Some of your aliens reject the innovation, holding to their traditions. However, a growing number of aliens want more. They have become fellows of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy, who cannot simply abide by the current, who must be more and more entertained.
