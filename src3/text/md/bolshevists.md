### Rights to Power

_These resources are as much mine as they are yours_ is what one alien told another alien today. It was quite the situation. The quoted alien was one to have just come back from a foreign continent. They played a part in a wartime effort. The other alien was one hailing from elite society, was protected from having to participate. They needed to remain alive to sign payroll checks.

The quoted alien, being looked down upon by the elite, having participated in the foreign continent's alien Bolshevist revolution, had become an real erudite scholar of egalitarian ideology and real alien Bolshevist. They were not going to take any of the elite alien's wage theft bullshit. They demanded a modest wage, saying "These resources are as much mine as they are yours."

Since your aliens are now capable of producing such riches, such problems as this are now possible. In worlds all across the galaxy, working aliens of pre-Federation planets contend with various types of alien privilege. Nepotists and cronies, various types of supremacists, as well as stereotypers and victim blamers, perpetuate the problems of alien societies and recreate them wherever possible.

Xa Kinaxen societal inequity flourished through the use of propaganda. Their propaganda was optimized for success by their computing skyscrapers. Dregons enforced supremacy with aggressiveness. Anyone who refused to duel, couldn't do much more than labor. Suun Stroundae social hierarchy relied on intellectual competition. Their social order was defined through limited access to academia. Goulpian aliens stabilized their inequity system by stabilizing the chemical balances of the alien minds of their working class. Their working class wouldn't even think of revolve.
