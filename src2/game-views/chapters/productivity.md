#### Productivity

Nice! Looks like you found out how to look through these story panels. I hope the _new_ superscript was informative enough to... umm... <sub>inform</sub> you it might be of interest...

<sup>I'm supposed to be good at like making websites or whatever, since I'm like a professional... or... whatever.</sup>

Anyway...

Productivity! Agriculture {TRACTOR} yields biological material useful to make food with. Aliens {ALIEN} will eat the food {DINNER_PLATE} and grow strong. Without the food {DINNER_PLATE} the aliens {ALIEN} will die, but without it they survive. Aliens {ALIEN} are resilient.

<sup>(I'm aiming to make the game {THE_GAME} only like set you back if you try to. I'm not perfect, so bear with me...)</sup>

Aliens {ALIEN} can be put to work and laid off. <sub>Just like people are... :(</sub>

Around these parts---the places found inside and outside any one world, the vast product space of the endless universe and ever-changing time---alien {ALIEN} lives are shaped by the Federation of Socialist Planets {FEDERATION}. By playing this game you hope to become a member of the Federation {FEDERATION}. You lead a society of alien workers {ALIEN} whose planet's resources are all collected and redistributed by the state (you). You do not profit from having ownership over the resources. You _must_ redistribute the resources, but you may do so however you see fit.

As a hopeful member of the Federation, you are an economist, a sociologist, a statistician, a mathematician, a planet emperor, whatever it is that you want to be.

However you _must_ call yourself a socialist. While playing the role of a Federation of Socialist Aliens hopeful {FEDERATION} you can be whomever or whatever you want to be, but you _have_ to be a socialist. Other than that, you are only you. You are not he nor she nor they. If I say otherwise it is most definitely a mistake <sub>and I would appreciate it if you filed a bug report</sub>!

Even though you must call yourself a socialist, you don't need to play as one. As you can see before you, you have many options. There are many buttons to press. You could employ aliens {ALIEN}, strive to keep employment a universal right, and make sure that there is not one alien contributing to the unemployment statistic <sup>which you can find in the quick view at the top by clicking the {ALIEN}</sup>. You could layoff aliens {ALIEN} on a whim, maintain the ability to capitalize on changes in markets that will become more diverse as new industries and ways to play the game become available. You could even choose anarchy, take no part in choosing the lives of aliens {ALIEN}.

You can do anything. You are _you_, after all.
