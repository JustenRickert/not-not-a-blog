#### Introduction

Hey, what's up? This isn't my blog; but I guess it's also not _not_ a blog. I am writing, after all. But it's not "really" a blog.

I guess you could call this _the game_ {THE_GAME}. Or _not **not** a blog_, which sounds almost alien {ALIEN} if you say it fast enough.

Not not a blog.

Not _not_ a blog.

Not _**not**_ a blog.

Anyway... Welcome to the game {THE_GAME}!

_The game_.

What _does_ that mean? Umm. Well. Who _cares_? I don't.

Here is how it is:

You like points {RED_TRIANGLE}. At least I'm assuming you do. You've stayed here long enough to see some of the numbers incrementing above, probably. (If not you should maybe take a look.) Presumably you were interested in them enough to read this.

If you are like me, you probably want to see those numbers be higher and want to see more of them. I'm a mathematician (or at least I call myself that), so I take an interest in numbers related to the definition of my (self-designated) title. I am not "really" a mathematician, but what is "really" anyone?

If you don't want to see those numbers be higher and want to see more of them at the moment, then you are _not_ like me. But if you are still interested (for whatever reason), then you might eventually _become_ more like me.

Anyway... At the outset you get only one point {RED_TRIANGLE} for every second that passes. It will account for moments you spent away, so don't be too pressured to stick around all the time.

You can go ahead and proceed with your life without me! :) I won't mind.

The other numbers you start out with are aliens {ALIEN} and agriculture {TRACTOR}.

I'll talk about them in more detail later. Just go ahead and click the _employ_ button 'round the agriculture {TRACTOR}. If you've already found it and clicked it: Stick around a bit. When you get one-hundred agricultural supplies {TRACTOR} the aliens {ALIEN} will figure out what to do with it.
